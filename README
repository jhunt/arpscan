What is it?
-----------

arpscan is a small, lightweight utility for scanning subnets via
ARP request packets, that operate strictly at the Ethernet layer
(no Layer 3, no ICMP).

The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't bother firewall
administrators, and is nearly impossible to block (blocking ARP
requests is tantamount to unplugging the network cable).  It's
also fast.


The Latest Version
------------------

arpscan source code is hosted on github:

How do I use it?
----------------

    $ arpscan eth0 192.168.0.0/24

You provide arpscan with a device name (`eth0`) and a CIDR-style
subnet (`192.168.0.0/24`) and arpscan will submit ARP requests for
every IP, from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, recording all
received ARP replies within a small window, and print them to
standard out, like this:

    68:7f:74:XX:XX:XX  192.168.0.1
    00:30:67:XX:XX:XX  192.168.0.32

This output format should be easy to read and easy to parse with
tools like Perl, grep, awk and sed.


Installation
------------

arpscan is packaged using Autotools (autoconf, automake, etc.):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If you don't have a configure script, you may need to run the
autotools themselves to get one:

    $ aclocal && autoconf
    $ automake --force-missing --add-missing

For more details, see INSTALL.
